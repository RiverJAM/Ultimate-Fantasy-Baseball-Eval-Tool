# Ultimate-Fantasy-Baseball-Eval-Tool

 
How do most people evaluate baseball players for possible selection for their fantasy baseball team?  Generally speaking, many people utilize rankings from sites, then go with their gut.  A lot of people will look at tables of the playerâ€™s underlying statistics to make decisions.  Some will even go so far as to look at the stats of multiple sites.  But what if instead you had a dashboard which would visually represent this data?  What if you could take data from a couple of sites and blend it together?  And what if you used some data science to take it to the next step?  Our project proposes we do just this.
